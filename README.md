Climaduino Heater PID Controller
=====================

This is a heater controller using PID control. Please do not use this with heatpumps or forced air heaters as the quick cycling may cause damage or premature failure.

Setup
=====
NOTE: Please use Arduino IDE <= 1.6.1. Does not work with Arduino IDE 1.6.2+ for some reason.

Load the climaduino sketch onto the Arduino YÃºn, then please refer to the README file in the mqtt_yun_bridge folder.
